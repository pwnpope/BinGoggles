- [x] Write valid assertions in test/test_cases.py
- [x] Improve the function to account for more SSA MLIL operations
- [x] Rename vfa.py to bg.py for clarity
- [x] Fix `get_struct_field_name` to handle nested field names
- [x] Add a Target class for defining analysis targets
- [X] Add support for imported functions
  - [X] Integrate imported function taint analysis into engine
  - NOTE: Must have the user supply a complete dependencies for example a library may import other libraries that must be resolved.
  - Ideally I want this to be an automated system, having the user manually supply a dependency graph is kind of a pita.
  - [X] Make a table for abstracting a ton of the libc write functions such as strcpy, memcpy and others that taint other arguments or return variables.
- [X] Add fix for incomplete trace for test case 'test_interproc_memcpy' 
- [X] Global var tracing support extended to miss out / break on edge cases
- [X] Add fixes to 'test_get_sliced_calls' 
  - [X] #BUG1: taint traces from parameters of function calls should not trace before the function call line of code only after, which we're seeing this bug in 
  the test case.
  - [X] #BUG2: function param a does not taint function param c at all, however we're seeing in our test case that a does indeed taint c
  - [X] #BUG3: return variables could be passed into interproc analysis 'trace_function_taint' if its a var_to_trace
- [X] Fixed flaw in 'test_complete_bkd_slice_var' where it would forward slice if the slice type is forward and the target is on a function call param

- [ ] fix bug in 'test_is_param_tainted' where it fails to find the tainted param
  - 'trace_function_taint' must be redone
- [X] fix bug test_fwd_slice_param tainting result as new trace

- [X] fix bug in 'test_set_var_field' and 'test_load_struct' where it gets incorrect references
  - fixed 'get_struct_field_refs' and added caching to improve speed when traversing struct members
