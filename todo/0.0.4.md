## VFG
- [ ] Variable Flow Graph (VFG) in the form of a Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- [ ] Simple non-DSA/SA constraint analysis in the VFG
- [ ] Write test cases for VFG generation
- [ ] Make sure the VFG represents the if statements and interproc stuff

- [ ] Make a function to recieve a given variable/taintedloc and make the tainted bingoggles object (taintedvar, taintedstructmember, ...)
    - this will remove a ton of redundant code and what not

- [] Make a tracking option for tainted offsets of variables (TaintedVarOffset)
    - will need to make a get_mlil_tainted_var_offset_refs or something

  - [ ] Memoize results; still trying to find out how to serialize it effectively, this is really useful for things like when your analyzing many binaries and they all use the same libc or something.
