- [x] Write valid assertions in test/test_cases.py
- [x] Improve the function to account for more SSA MLIL operations
- [x] Rename vfa.py to bg.py for clarity
- [x] Fix `get_struct_field_name` to handle nested field names
- [x] Add a Target class for defining analysis targets
- [X] Add support for imported functions
  - [X] Integrate imported function taint analysis into engine
  - [ ] Memoize results; still trying to find out how to serialize it effectively, this is really useful for things like when your analyzing many binaries and they all use the same libc or something.
  - NOTE: Must have the user supply a complete dependencies for example a library may import other libraries that must be resolved.
  - Ideally I want this to be an automated system, having the user manually supply a dependency graph is kind of a pita.
  - [X] Make a table for abstracting a ton of the libc write functions such as strcpy, memcpy and others that taint other arguments or return variables.
- [X] Add fix for incomplete trace for test case 'test_interproc_memcpy' 
- [X] Global var tracing support extended to miss out / break on edge cases
- [X] Add fixes to 'test_get_sliced_calls' 
  - [X] #BUG1: taint traces from parameters of function calls should not trace before the function call line of code only after, which we're seeing this bug in 
  the test case.
  - [X] #BUG2: function param a does not taint function param c at all, however we're seeing in our test case that a does indeed taint c
  - [X] #BUG3: return variables could be passed into interproc analysis 'trace_function_taint' if its a var_to_trace
- [X] Fixed flaw in 'test_complete_bkd_slice_var' where it would forward slice if the slice type is forward and the target is on a function call param
- [ ] fix bug in 'test_is_param_tainted' where it fails to find the tainted param
- [ ] fix bug in 'test_set_var_field' and 'test_load_struct' where it gets incorrect references
  - also try to find what is making the get_struct_refs so slow...
